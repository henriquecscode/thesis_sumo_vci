Exploring how the mechanisms for connections work
    There are edges of type internal. These are not shown in netedit.
    For a junction, the attribute intLanes refers to these edges, and are the edges that make up the connection/junction space.
    These internal edges have as their name {id_of_the_jucntion_they_are_internal_to}_{internal_lane_id}
About the added counters
    Is it too many one per lane at every junction with different number of edges? Overkill
The scripts to make the calibrator counters both at the entry and exit junctions was complemented (in the future to be substituted?) by scripts to only add calibrators at the entry edges
