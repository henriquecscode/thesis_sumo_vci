Reimagining the Neural Network
    Could have not only neural network but other methods to predict best parameters for calibration
    Input parameters can also be travel times or other traffic measures easily calculated in SUMO?

Running sumo through traci. For some reason the output files for the calibrators and for the counters go in different folders
Induction loops may be done for only certain vehicle types.
    Means we need to create multiple induction loops for each of the allowed vehicle types


Online calibration through ML (consideration while thining of NNs)
    We can have one static model
        Different inputs will give different outputs, meaning different parameteres
        How to train this model:
            Option1: (Offline)
                Run the simulation with arbitrary parameters. 
                Record the data that would be input data
                After the simulation being run train the model based on that: adjust the weights so that the input data gives the parameters
            Option2: (Online)
                Start a simulation
                Have some starting parameters
                In an interval record the data
                Make a prediction from the ML for what the starting parameters are
                Optimize the model
                Change the parameters or not
            In neither of the options is the model influencing the simulator, it's just learning on top of it

    We can have a dynamic model:
        Training of the model is simultaneous to parameter prediction. 
        This means that in 2 adjacent steps with the same inputs may have different parameters.

    ML calibration of parameters considerations:
        Normally, ML happens in the following sequence
            Inputs - ML -> Prediction -> Optimize by comparing with output
        Our ML
            Inputs (counts) - ML -> Prediction (parameters) -> Optimize by comparing with real output (parameters)
            Counterintuitively, however, in the context of a simulation, the counts are the outputs and the parameters are the inputs
