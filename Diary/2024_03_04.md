COnsiderations on the information received from [ARMIS Workshop](./2024_03_01.md)
    Guy said we could consider we already have every counter, so no need to do systems of equations?
    Can instead try to update the parameters of the calibrator based on the real data flow
        Check the papers that did online parameter calibration
    We have 2 problems that we can try solving
        Problem 1: How to configure parameteres outside of the normal operation scenario (for which neural networks appear to be good enough)
        Problem 2: How to change the infrastructure in real time?
            Use rerouters in the simulator, and have the operator interface with them
    Question: What time scale are we thinking of when we think of changes to the conditions? 5 minutes? 1 hour? 6 hours?
    Note: Even if the NN is good, we want to be able to run the simulation all the time, so that the parameters are more or less calibrated when said chnanges to the conditions happen
Calibrators can also be used as variable speed signs
    "Furthermore, the defined edge speed will be adjusted to the specified speed similar of the operation of a variable speed sign."
Investigated rerouters.
    There are 5 types of configurations for rerouters:
        destProbReroute
        closingReroute
        closingLaneReroute
        routeProbReroute: Couldn't implement. Assuming must have a route prober additional defined.
        ParkingAreaReroute: for this must have a parking area additional defined
    A rerouter can have multiple intervals defined, in which the respective configurations will be applied
    Example of code
        ```
        <parkingArea id="pa_5" lane="597084095_0" startPos="69.71" endPos="79.71"/>
        <rerouter id="rr_0" edges="597084095" pos="1501.88,3615.71">
            <interval begin="0.00" end="100.00">
                <closingLaneReroute id="105482346_0" allow="all"/>
                <destProbReroute id="105482346" probability="1.00"/>
                <closingReroute id="105482346" allow="all"/>
                <destProbReroute id="105482346" probability="1.00"/>
            </interval>
            <interval begin="100.00" end="3400.00">
                <destProbReroute id="105482346" probability="1.00"/>
            </interval>
            <interval begin="3400.00" end="3600.00">
                <parkingAreaReroute id="pa_5" visible="1"/>
            </interval>
        </rerouter>
        ```

Investigated closing part of lane
    Could be done by setting the type of vehicles allowed to only "authority"
    Could probably be done by a closingLaneReroute
    Both the previous scenarios don't allow to set a length, or just a subsection of the lane
    Another way to be done, is to create an invisible/ghost vehicle and stop it
